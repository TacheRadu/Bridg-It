# Bridg-It
Introduction to Programming Project

You can find information about the game Bridg-It online.

We are supposed to replicate the game, using c++. We are not allowed to use STL and anything object-oriented, except for the string object and graphics libraries, such as SFML and SDL.

We as the team doing it have decided that we'll use [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/) as the IDE, and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) as the graphics library. All you need to know to configure SFML for your work environment is covered in their [tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/).
